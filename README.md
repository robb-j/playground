# playground

This is a place for me to play about with code, probably web-related. There shouldn't be anything that is production ready. Everything is published at [playground.r0b.io](https://playground.r0b.io).

## playground rules

- use the latest and greatest web standards (stage 3+)
- no build step
- html/css/js in that order
